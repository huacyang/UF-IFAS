### Building Blocks

To compile the HTML files for use in the DPS App Builder, navigate to the `public_html` folder, select all the files/folders inside, and choose "Compress ...".

### CSS Framework

The stylesheet for this Storefront utilizes the [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com) responsive front-end framework.

To edit the stylesheet, proceed to either step 1 or 2:

1. make changes to the scss files in the `SCSS` folder (if you don't know what SCSS means, proceed to alternative step #2)
2. make changes to the css files in the `public_html > css` folder


### JS Framework

There were no javascript framework used in the process, it was stripped down in favor of ease of use.
